# Description

The IFZ Fortifications Rebalanced Mod attempts to improve the game's early and late game fortifications by increasing/decreasing their strucutral integrity (HP) in specific ratios. Wooden, Metal and Brick Walls had their HP increased, and Towers and Gates now have 2x and 3x of the HP of their walls. The Fortified Wall had its HP drastically increased and its towers and gates have 80% and 60% of the new wall HP respectively.

## How to Install

1. Download and install [IFZ-Moder](https://github.com/ChopperMonster/IFZ-Moder "IFZ-Moder"). Launch the game with it installed and working at least one.
2. Download this Git as a .zip file, open it and put the "Json" folder in the "Infection Free Zone_Data\StreamingAssets" folder.
3. Load up a save or start a new game. Walls, towers and gates will now have the mod's HP values instead of the base game values.

Made for and tested on game version 0.24.6.18 1 BETA. Earlier and future versions may be unsupported due to the game being in early access with semi-frequent updates.
