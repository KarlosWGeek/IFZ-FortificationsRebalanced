## Description

The IFZ Fortifications Rebalanced Mod attempts to improve the game's early and late game fortifications by increasing/decreasing their strucutral integrity (HP) in specific ratios.
Wooden, Metal and Brick Walls had their HP increased to 1000, 2500 and 5000 respectively. Towers and Gates now have 2x and 3x of the HP of their walls.
Fortified Walls now have a massive 20000 HP but the Towers and Gates only have 80% and 60% of that, to more accurately reflect gates and towers being natural weak points in real life fortifications.

## How to Install

1) Download IFZ-Moder from the Git.
2) Replace "IFZ.dll" in the "Infection Free Zone_Data\Managed" folder.
3) Place the "Json" folder in the "Infection Free Zone_Data\StreamingAssets" folder.
4) Open the game to finish installing IFZ-Moder.
5) Close the game and then install IFZ Fortifications Rebalanced Mod by placing the "Json" folder in the "Infection Free Zone_Data\StreamingAssets" folder.
6) Load up a save or start a new game. Walls, towers and gates will now have the rebalanced HP.
